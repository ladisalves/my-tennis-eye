Was it in or out?

## Phase 1 Prototype
The Phase 1 prototype lives in `src/` and provides a mobile-first calibration UI for mapping a tennis court corner. It uses a video element, a canvas overlay, and OpenCV.js (loaded via CDN) to warp "in" and "out" zone overlays on top of the live camera feed.

No build tooling is configured yet; the TypeScript file is provided to guide the expected implementation. If you add a build step later, document it here.

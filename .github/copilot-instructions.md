# Copilot Instructions for My Tennis Eye

## Project context
- This repository is currently in an early stage and may not have a full application structure yet.
- The goal is to build a product that helps determine whether a tennis ball was in or out.

## General guidance
- Favor clarity and explicitness over cleverness.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the request.
- Prefer small, composable functions with descriptive names.
- Write code and documentation that can be understood by someone new to the project.

## Style and conventions
- Use consistent naming and formatting within any new files you add.
- If you create a script, include a brief header comment describing its purpose.
- Keep line lengths reasonable and wrap long markdown lines for readability.

## Testing and validation
- If you add executable code, include a short note in the PR about how to run or validate it.
- If no automated tests exist, avoid inventing them; document any manual checks instead.

## Documentation expectations
- Update or add README notes whenever you introduce a new module or workflow.
- Provide short, task-oriented examples for any new CLI or scripts.
